# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer Project

This is a personal project aimed to create interactive visualizations for various sorting algorithms.
Watching a visual of sorting algorithms has always been something that has greatly helped me study
and understand them better. I wanted to create something that would help myself and other
people gain a better understanding and appreciation for sorting algorithms.

The user can generate random arrays of all sizes, and choose from (currently) three different
sorting algorithms. The project is still in production and incomplete. The next step is to actually
animate the currently implemented algorithms, and then eventually add many more algorithms to visualize.

The project can be found here:

Enjoy!
