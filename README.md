# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer Project

This is a personal project aimed to create interactive visualizations for various sorting algorithms.
Watching a visual of sorting algorithms has always been something that has greatly helped me study
and understand them better. I wanted to create something that would help myself and other
people gain a better understanding and appreciation for sorting algorithms.
