# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer Project

This is a personal project aimed to create interactive visualizations for various sorting algorithms.
Watching a visual of sorting algorithms has always been something that has greatly helped me study
and understand them better. I wanted to create something that would help myself and other
people gain a better understanding and appreciation for sorting algorithms.

The user can generate random arrays of all sizes, and choose from (currently) three different
sorting algorithms. **This project is still in production and incomplete.** The next step is to actually
animate the currently implemented algorithms, and then eventually add many more algorithms to visualize.

The project can be found here:

Enjoy!
